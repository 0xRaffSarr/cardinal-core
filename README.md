# Cardinal

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Cardinal framework. If you are looking for the official repository, visit [Cardinal](https://github.com/0xRaffSarr/cardinal).

Cardinal is a modular web micro-framework inspired by Laravel's MVC structure.

The project was born with no aim to be like a framework neither to be published, so sorry for non-English commits and some errors!

âš ðŸ›  **ATTENTION!** ðŸ› âš 

Currently this is a fully <abbr title="Work In Progress">WIP</abbr> project and is still not suited for production!<br>
Any help is strongfully appreciated!

We invite you to ask us anything via the **Issues** section at the moment!
